# BST 知识点（理论讲解，来源 VisuAlgo）

## Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized type of binary tree in which each vertex can have up to two children. This structure adheres to the
BST property
, stipulating that every vertex in the left subtree of a given vertex must carry a value smaller than that of the given vertex, and every vertex in the right subtree must carry a value larger. This visualization implements 'multiset' property: Although all keys remain distinct integers, information of duplicated integers are stored as a frequency attribute (only shown for keys that appear more than once). For a demonstration, use the
Search(7)
function to animate the search for a random value within the range of 1 to 99 in the randomly generated BST above.
An Adelson-Velskii Landis (AVL) tree is a
self-balancing
BST that maintains its height within a logarithmic order (O(log
N
)) relative to the number of vertices (
N
) present in the AVL tree.

## BST & Balanced BST (AVL Tree)

To switch between the standard Binary Search Tree and the AVL Tree (which primarily differs during the insertion and removal of an integer), please select the corresponding header.
We also provide a URL shortcut for quick access to the AVL Tree mode, available at
https://visualgo.net/en/avl
. The 'en' in the URL can be replaced with the two-character code of your preferred language, if available.

## Motivation

A BST, particularly a balanced BST such as an AVL Tree, is an effective data structure for implementing
a certain type
of
Table
(or
Map
) Abstract Data Type (ADT).
A Table ADT should efficiently support
at least
the following three operations:
Search(v) — ascertain whether
v
exists within the ADT,
Insert(v) — add
v
into the ADT,
Remove(v) — eliminate
v
from the ADT.
For a similar discussion, refer to the
Hash Table e-Lecture slides
.

## What Kind of Table ADT?

We are referring to a particular type of Table ADT where the keys must be ordered. This contrasts with other types of Table ADTs that allow for unordered keys.
The specific requirements of this Table ADT type will be clarified in the subsequent slides.

## Using Unsorted Array/Vector

Using an
unsorted
array or vector to implement a Table ADT can result in inefficiencies:
Search(v) operates in O(
N
) time complexity because we may need to traverse all
N
elements of the ADT if
v
doesn't exist,
Insert(v) can be implemented with O(
1
) time complexity, by simply appending
v
at the end of the array,
Remove(v) also runs in O(
N
) time complexity, as we first need to search for
v
(which is already O(
N
)), and then close the gap resulting from the deletion — also an O(
N
) operation.

## Using Sorted Array/Vector

Implementing a Table ADT with a
sorted
array or vector can enhance the performance of Search(v), but this comes at the expense of Insert(v) performance:
Search(v) can now be implemented with a time complexity of O(log
N
), as we can employ a binary search strategy on the sorted array,
Insert(v) now operates with a time complexity of O(
N
), as we need to use an insertion-sort-like strategy to ensure the array remains sorted,
Remove(v) still runs in O(
N
) time complexity. Although Search(v) operates in O(log
N
), we still have to close the gap resulting from the deletion, which runs in O(
N
).

## O(log N) Complexities?

The objective of this e-Lecture is to introduce the BST and the balanced BST data structure, namely the AVL Tree, which enable us to implement basic Table ADT operations like Search(v), Insert(v), and Remove(v) —
along with a few other Table ADT operations
(refer to the next slide) — in O(log
N
) time. This time complexity is significantly smaller than
N
. Please try the interactive slider below to feel the significant difference.
log
N
=
20
,
N
=
1048576
.
PS: More experienced readers may note the existence of
another data structure
that can perform these three basic Table ADT operations more swiftly. But, keep reading...

## Other Table ADT Operations

In addition to the basic three operations, there are several other Table ADT operations:
Find the Min()/Max() element,
Find the Successor(v), or the 'next larger' element, and Predecessor(v), or the 'previous smaller' element,
List elements in sorted order,
Rank(v) & Select(k)
,
There are other possible operations as well.
Discussion: Given the constraint of using either a sorted or unsorted array/vector, what would be the optimal implementation for the first three additional operations above?

## The Answer

With an unsorted array, finding the Min()/Max() operates in O(
N
) time complexity, as we don't know where the minimum or maximum element is located. Finding the Successor(v)/Predecessor(v) also runs in O(
N
) for the same reason. Listing elements in sorted order requires using a sorting algorithm, so the time complexity can be O(
N
log
N
).
In contrast, with a sorted array, finding the Min()/Max() operates in O(
1
) time complexity, as the minimum and maximum elements reside in the first and last positions respectively. Finding the Successor(v)/Predecessor(v) is also O(1) — simply move back or forward by one index from
v
, respectively. Listing elements in sorted order is a straightforward O(
N
) operation, as it simply involves enumerating from the first to the last element, given that the array is already sorted. This approach appears advantageous, but it becomes ineffective when further insertions and/or deletions are needed.

## What about Linked List?

The simpler data structure that can be used to implement Table ADT is
Linked List
.
Quiz:
Can we perform all basic three Table ADT operations: Search(v)/Insert(v)/Remove(v) efficiently (read: faster than O(
N
)) using Linked List?
No
Yes
Submit
Discussion: Why?

## The Answer

Even when using a
sorted
linked list, executing a binary search isn't feasible as it's not easy to instantly jump to the middle element of a linked list. For insertion, an insertion-sort-like process is required to correctly position
v
, which runs in O(
N
) time complexity. Similarly, removal presents the same issue as the search operation.

## What about Hash Table?

Another data structure that can be used to implement Table ADT is
Hash Table
. It has very fast Search(v), Insert(v), and Remove(v) performance (all in expected O(
1
) time).
Quiz:
So what is the point of learning this BST module if Hash Table can do the crucial Table ADT operations in unlikely-to-be-beaten expected O(
1
) time?
There are valid reasons, which are ____
There is no point, so this BST module can be ignored
Submit
Discuss the answer above! Hint: Go back to
the previous 4 slides ago
.

## The Answer

Many
additional Table ADT operations
require the Table ADT elements to be ordered.
If the order of the elements is not a requirement, we can utilize an unordered Hash Table data structure. This structure provides very fast, i.e., O(
1
) time complexity for Search(v), Insert(v), and Remove(v) operations.
However, if we need to perform queries that involve the order of elements in the Table ADT, the BST data structure is the preferred choice, particularly its balanced version, which will be discussed shortly.

## Visualization

We will now introduce the BST data structure. Refer to the visualization of an example BST provided above!
In a BST, the root vertex is unique and has no parent. Conversely, a leaf vertex, of which there can be several, has no children. Vertices that aren't leaves are known as internal vertices. Occasionally, the root vertex isn't included in the definition of an internal vertex as a BST with only one vertex (that root vertex) could technically fit the definition of a leaf as well.
In the illustrated example, vertex 15 is the root, vertices 5, 7, and 50 are the leaves, and vertices 4, 6, 15 (which is also the root), 23, and 71 are the internal vertices.

## BST Vertex Attributes

Each vertex has several key attributes: pointer to the left child, pointer to the right child, pointer to the parent vertex, key/value/data, and special for this visualization that implements 'multiset': frequency of each key (there are potential other attributes). Not all attributes will be used for all vertices, e.g., the leaf vertex will have both their left and right child attributes = NULL. Some other implementation separates key (for ordering of vertices in the BST) with the actual
satellite data
associated with the keys.
The left/right child of a vertex (except leaf) is drawn on the left/right and below of that vertex, respectively. The parent of a vertex (except root) is drawn above that vertex. The (integer) key of each vertex is drawn inside the circle that represent that vertex and if there are duplicated insertion of the same (integer) key, there will be an additional hyphen '-' and the actual frequency (≥ 2) of that key. In the example above, (key) 15 has 6 as its left child and 23 as its right child. Thus the parent of 6 (and 23) is 15. Some keys may have '-' (actual frequency) in random fashion.
Discussion: It is actually possible to omit the parent pointer from each vertex. How?

## Removing the Parent Pointer

Only the current
Successor(v) and Predecessor(v) shown in VisuAlgo
actually need the parent pointer so that we can go upwards from a vertex to its parent.
One day, we will modify the visualization of Successor(v) and Predecessor(v) that search for the Successor/Predecessor of
v
downwards from the root vertex, thereby removing the need to use the parent pointer, i.e., BST becomes a rooted and directed-downwards only tree.

## BST Property

We allow duplicate integers in this visualization by keeping the
N
(integer) keys distinct, but any duplication of an existing key will be stored as 'frequency' attribute of that key (visualized as '-' (actual frequency, but only if it is ≥ 2)). Thus we can use the simple BST property as follow: For every vertex X, all vertices on the left subtree of X are
strictly
smaller than X and all vertices on the right subtree of X are
strictly
greater than X.
In the example above, the vertices on the left subtree of the root 15: {4, 5, 6, 7} are all smaller than 15 and the vertices on the right subtree of the root 15: {23, 50, 71} are all greater than 15. You can recursively check BST property on other vertices too.
In this visualization, we allow the keys to be in range of [-99..99].

## BST Operations

We provide visualization for the following common BST/AVL Tree operations:
Query operations (the BST structure remains unchanged):
Search(v) (or LowerBound(v)),
Predecessor(v) (and similarly Successor(v)), and
Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Traversal,
Update operations (the BST structure (most likely) change):
Create BST (several criteria),
Insert(v), and
Remove(v).

## A Few Other BST Operations

There are a few other BST (Query) operations that have not been visualized in VisuAlgo:
Rank(v): Given a key
v
, determine what is its rank (1-based index) in the sorted order of the BST elements. That is, Rank(FindMin()) = 1 and Rank(FindMax()) =
N
. If
v
does not exist, we can report -1.
Select(k): Given a rank
k
, 1 ≤
k
≤
N
, determine the key
v
that has that rank
k
in the BST. Or in another word, find the
k
-th smallest element in the BST. That is, Select(1) = FindMin() and Select(
N
) = FindMax().
The details of these two operations are currently hidden for pedagogical purpose in a certain NUS course.

## Static vs Dynamic Data Structure

Data structure that is only efficient if there is no (or rare) update, especially the insert and/or remove operation(s) is called
static
data structure.
Data structure that is efficient even if there are many update operations is called
dynamic
data structure. BST and especially balanced BST (e.g., AVL Tree) are in this category.

## Search(v)

Because of the way data (distinct integers for this visualization) is organised inside a BST, we can
binary
search for an integer
v
efficiently (hence the name of
Binary Search
Tree).
First, we set the current vertex = root and then check if the current vertex is smaller/equal/larger than integer
v
that we are searching for. We then go to the right subtree/stop/go the left subtree, respectively. We keep doing this until we either find the required vertex or we don't.
On the example BST above, try clicking
Search(23)
(found after 2 comparisons),
Search(7)
(found after 3 comparisons),
Search(21)
(not found after 2 comparisons — at this point we will realize that we cannot find 21).

## lower_bound(v)

Note that this term is based on the definition given in
C++ std::set::lower_bound
. Other programming languages, e.g., Java TreeSet has a similar method "higher()".
If
v
exists in the BST, then lower_bound(v) is the same as Search(v). But, if
v
does not exist in the BST, lower_bound(v) will find the smallest value in the BST that is strictly larger than
v
(unless
v
> the largest element in the BST). This is the location of this currently non-existent
v
if it is later inserted into this BST.

## SearchMin() and SearchMax()

Similarly, because of the way data is organised inside a BST, we can find the minimum/maximum element (an integer in this visualization) by starting from root and keep going to the left/right subtree, respectively.
Try clicking
SearchMin()
and
SearchMax()
on the example BST shown above. The answers should be 4 and 71 (both after comparing against 3 integers from root to leftmost vertex/rightmost vertex, respectively).

## O(h) Time Complexity

Search(v)/lower_bound(v)/SearchMin()/SearchMax() operations run in O(
h
) where
h
is the height of the BST.
But note that this
h
can be as tall as O(
N
) in a normal BST as shown in the random 'skewed right' example above. Try
Search(100)
(this value should not exist as we only use random integers between [1..99] to generate this random BST and thus the Search routine should check all the way from root to the only leaf in O(
N
) time — not efficient.

## Successor(v)

Because of the BST properties, we can find the Successor of an integer
v
(assume that we already know where integer
v
is located from earlier call of Search(
v
)) as follows:
If
v
has a right subtree, the minimum integer in the right subtree of
v
must be the successor of
v
. Try
Successor(23)
(should be 50).
If
v
does not have a right subtree, we need to traverse the ancestor(s) of
v
until we find 'a right turn' to vertex
w
(or alternatively, until we find the first vertex
w
that is greater than vertex
v
). Once we find vertex
w
, we will see that vertex
v
is the maximum element in the left subtree of
w
. Try
Successor(7)
(should be 15).
If
v
is the maximum integer in the BST,
v
does not have a successor. Try
Successor(71)
(should be none).

## Predecessor(v)

The operations for Predecessor of an integer
v
are defined similarly (just the mirror of Successor operations).
Try the same three corner cases (but mirrored):
Predecessor(6)
(should be 5),
Predecessor(50)
(should be 23),
Predecessor(4)
(should be none).
At this point, stop and ponder these three Successor(v)/Predecessor(v) cases to ensure that you understand these concepts.

## O(h) Time Complexity

Predecessor(v) and Successor(v) operations run in O(
h
) where
h
is the height of the BST.
But recall that this
h
can be as tall as O(
N
) in a normal BST as shown in the random 'skewed right' example above. If we call
Successor(FindMax())
, we will go up from that last leaf back to the root in O(
N
) time — not efficient.

## Inorder Traversal

We can perform an
Inorder Traversal
of this BST to obtain a list of sorted integers inside this BST (in fact, if we 'flatten' the BST into one line, we will see that the vertices are ordered from smallest/leftmost to largest/rightmost).
Inorder Traversal is a recursive method whereby we visit the left subtree first, exhausts all items in the left subtree, visit the current root, before exploring the right subtree and all items in the right subtree. Without further ado, let's try
Inorder Traversal
to see it in action on the example BST above.

## O(N) Time Complexity

Inorder Traversal runs in O(
N
), regardless of the height of the BST.
Discussion: Why?
PS: Some people call insertion of
N
unordered integers into a BST in O(
N
log
N
) and then performing the O(
N
) Inorder Traversal as '
BST sort
'. It is rarely used though as there are several easier-to-use (comparison-based)
sorting algorithms
than this.

## The Answer

Notice that regardless the structure of the BST, Inorder Traversal will visit each vertex once (to be precise, three times: from parent, returning from left subtree, and returning from right subtree). As there are
N
vertices, Inorder Traversal runs in O(
3*N
) = O(
N
).

## Preorder and Postorder Traversal

We have included the animation for both Preorder and Postorder tree traversal methods.
Basically, in Preorder Traversal, we visit the current root before going to left subtree and then right subtree. For the example BST shown in the background, we have: {{15}, {6, 4, 5, 7}, {23, 71, 50}}. PS: Do you notice the recursive pattern? root, members of left subtree of root, members of right subtree of root.
In Postorder Traversal, we visit the left subtree and right subtree first, before visiting the current root. For the example BST shown in the background, we have: {{5, 4, 7, 6}, {50, 71, 23}, {15}}.
Discussion: Given a Preorder Traversal of a BST, e.g., [15, 6, 4, 5, 7, 23, 71, 50], can you use it to recover the original BST? Similar question for Postorder is also possible.

## The Answer

If we are given a Preorder Traversal of a BST, e.g., [[15], 6, 4, 5, 7, 23, 71, 50], we know that the
first
element in the Preorder Traversal must be the root of the BST, in this case: 15.
We can then scan the rest of the traversal and stop at the first element that is greater than 23, i.e., [6, 4, 5, 7]. This must be the elements of the left subtree of BST rooted at 15. The rest, i.e., [23, 71, 50] must be the elements of the right subtree of BST rooted at 15.
We can apply the same recursive process to reconstruct the whole BST.

## Insert(v)

We can insert a new integer into BST by doing similar operation as
Search(v)
. But this time, instead of reporting that the new integer is not found, we create a new vertex in the insertion point and put the new integer there. Try
Insert(60)
on the example above (the first insertion will create a new vertex, but see below).
Since we now implement 'multiset', we can insert a duplicate element, e.g., try
Insert(7)
on the example above (multiple times) or click
Insert(60)
again (the duplicate(s)).

## O(h) Time Complexity

Insert(v)
runs in O(
h
) where
h
is the height of the BST.
By now you should be aware that this
h
can be as tall as O(
N
) in a normal BST as shown in the random 'skewed right' example above. If we call
Insert(FindMax()+1)
, i.e. we insert a new integer greater than the current max, we will go from root down to the last leaf and then insert the new integer as the right child of that last leaf in O(
N
) time — not efficient (note that we only allow up to h=9 in this visualization).

## Mini Quiz

Inserting integers [1,10,2,9,3,8,4,7,5,6] one by one in that order into an initially empty BST will result in a BST of height:

Pro-tip: You can use the 'Exploration mode' to verify the answer.

## Remove(v) - Three Possible Cases

We can remove an integer in BST by performing similar operation as
Search(v)
.
If
v
is not found in the BST, we simply do nothing.
If
v
is found in the BST, we do not report that the existing integer
v
is found, but instead, we do the following checks. If the frequency of
v
is ≥ 2, we simply decrease its frequency by one without doing anything else. However, if the frequency of
v
is exactly 1, we perform one of the three possible removal cases that will be elaborated in three separate slides (we suggest that you try each of them one by one).

## Remove(v) - Case 1

The first case is the easiest: Vertex
v
is currently one of the leaf vertex of the BST.
Deletion of a leaf vertex is very easy: We just remove that leaf vertex — try
Remove(5)
on the example BST above (if the randomization causes vertex 5 to have more than one copy, just click that button again).
This part is clearly O(
1
) — on top of the earlier O(
h
) search-like effort.

## Remove(v) - Case 2

The second case is also not that hard: Vertex
v
is an (internal/root) vertex of the BST and it has
exactly one child
. Removing
v
without doing anything else will disconnect the BST.
Deletion of a vertex with one child is not that hard: We connect that vertex's only child with that vertex's parent — try
Remove(23)
on the example BST above (if the randomization causes vertex 23 to have more than one copy, just click that button again).
This part is also clearly O(
1
) — on top of the earlier O(
h
) search-like effort.

## Remove(v) - Case 3

The third case is the most complex among the three: Vertex
v
is an (internal/root) vertex of the BST and it has
exactly two children
. Removing
v
without doing anything else will disconnect the BST.
Deletion of a vertex with two children is as follow: We replace that vertex with its successor, and then delete its duplicated successor in its right subtree — try
Remove(6)
on the example BST above (if the randomization causes vertex 6 to have more than one copy, just click that button again).
This part requires O(
h
) due to the need to find the successor vertex — on top of the earlier O(
h
) search-like effort.

## Remove(v) - Case 3 Discussion

This case 3 warrants further discussions:
Why replacing a vertex
B
that has two children with its successor
C
is always a valid strategy?
Can we replace vertex
B
that has two children with its predecessor
A
instead? Why or why not?

## The Answer

We claim that vertex
C
, which is the successor of vertex
B
that has two children, must only have at most one child (which is an easier removal case).
Vertex
B
has two children, so
B
must have a right child. Let's name it
R
. Successor of
B
must be the minimum vertex of subtree rooted at
R
. Remember that the minimum element of a subtree in BST has
no left child
(it may have right child). Thus,
C
, the successor of
B
has at most one child.
Before removal, we have
X (may be empty) < A < B < C < Z (may be empty)
in the BST. Replacing
B
with its successor
C
then deleting the old and duplicate
C
will maintain the BST properties of all vertices involved. Similarly replacing
B
with its predecessor
A
will also achieve the same result. We just need to be consistent.

## O(h) Time Complexity

Remove(v)
runs in O(
h
) where
h
is the height of the BST. Removal case 3 (deletion of a vertex with two children is the 'heaviest' but it is not more than O(
h
)).
As you should have fully understand by now,
h
can be as tall as O(
N
) in a normal BST as shown in the random 'skewed right' example above. If we call
Remove(FindMax())
, i.e. we remove the current max integer, we will go from root down to the last leaf in O(
N
) time before removing it (when its frequency is 1) — not efficient.

## Create BST

To make life easier in 'Exploration Mode', you can create a new BST using these options:
Empty
BST (you can then insert a few integers one by one),
A few
e-Lecture Examples
that you may have seen several times so far,
Random
BST (which is unlikely to be extremely tall — the expected height of a randomly built BST is still O(log
N
)),
Skewed Left/Right
BST (tall BST with
N
vertices and
N-1
linked-list like edges, to showcase the worst case behavior of BST operations; disabled in AVL Tree mode).

## Intermezzo

We are midway through the explanation of this BST module. So far we notice that many basic Table ADT operations run in O(
h
) and
h
can be as tall as
N-1
edges like the 'skewed left' example shown — inefficient :(...
So, is there a way to make our BSTs 'not that tall'?
PS: If you want to study how these basic BST operations are implemented in a real program, you can download this
BSTDemo.cpp

java
.

## Try Exploration Mode

At this point, we encourage you to press [Esc] or click the X button on the bottom right of this e-Lecture slide to enter the 'Exploration Mode' and try various BST operations yourself to strengthen your understanding about this versatile data structure.
When you are ready to continue with the explanation of
balanced
BST (we use
AVL Tree
as our example), press [Esc] again or switch the mode back to 'e-Lecture Mode' from the top-right corner drop down menu. Then, use the slide selector drop down list to resume from
this slide 12-1
.

## Balanced BST

We have seen from earlier slides that most of our BST operations except Inorder traversal runs in O(
h
) where
h
is the height of the BST that can be as tall as
N-1
.
We will continue our discussion with the concept of
balanced BST
so that
h
= O(log
N
).

## AVL Tree

There are several known implementations of balanced BST, too many to be visualized and explained one by one in VisuAlgo.
We focus on
AVL Tree
(Adelson-Velskii & Landis, 1962) that is named after its inventor: Adelson-Velskii and Landis.
Other balanced BST implementations (more or less as good or slightly better in terms of constant-factor performance) are: Red-Black Tree, B-trees/2-3-4 Tree (Bayer & McCreight, 1972), Splay Tree (Sleator and Tarjan, 1985), Skip Lists (Pugh, 1989), Treaps (Seidel and Aragon, 1996), etc.

## Extra BST Attribute: height(v)

To facilitate AVL Tree implementation, we need to
augment
— add more information/attribute to — each BST vertex.
For each vertex
v
, we define
height(v)
: The number of edges on the path from vertex
v
down to its deepest leaf. This attribute is saved in each vertex so we can access a vertex's height in O(
1
) without having to recompute it every time.

## Formal Definition of height(v)

Formally:
v.height = -1 (if v is an empty tree)
v.height = max(v.left.height, v.right.height) + 1 (otherwise)
The height of the BST is thus:
root.height
.
On the example BST above, height(11) = height(32) = height(50) = height(72) = height(99) = 0 (all are leaves). height(29) = 1 as there is 1 edge connecting it to its only leaf 32.

## Mini Quiz

Quiz:
What are the values of height(20), height(65), and height(41) on the BST above?
height(41) = 4
height(65) = 3
height(41) = 3
height(20) = 2
height(65) = 2
height(20) = 3

## The Lower Bound of BST Height

If we have
N
elements/items/keys in our BST, the lower bound height
h
= Ω(log
2
N
) (the detailed formula in the next slide) if we can somehow insert the
N
elements in perfect order so that the BST is perfectly balanced.
See the example shown above for
N = 15
(a perfect BST which is rarely achievable in real life — try inserting any other (distinct) integer and it will not be perfect anymore).

N
elements/items/keys in our BST, the upper bound height
h
= O(
N
) if we insert the elements in ascending order (to get skewed right BST as shown above).
The height of such BST is
h = N-1
, so we have
h < N
.
Discussion: Do you know how to get skewed left BST instead?

## The Solution

Very simple, insert the elements in descending order (from empty BST).

## The Combined Bound

We have seen that most BST operations are in O(
h
) and combining the lower and upper bounds of
h
, we have log
2
N
<
h
<
N
.
There is a dramatic difference between log
2
N
and
N
and we have seen from the discussion of the lower bound that getting perfect BST (at all times) is near impossible...
So can we have BST that has height closer to log
2
N
, i.e.
c
* log
2
N
, for a small constant factor
c
? If we can, then BST operations that run in O(
h
) actually run in O(log
N
)...

## AVL Tree

Introducing AVL Tree, invented by two Russian (Soviet) inventors: Georgy Adelson-Velskii and Evgenii Landis, back in 1962.
In AVL Tree, we will later see that its height
h
< 2 * log
N
(tighter analysis exist, but we will use easier analysis in VisuAlgo where
c = 2
). Therefore, most AVL Tree operations run in O(log
N
) time — efficient.
Insert(v) and Remove(v) update operations may change the height
h
of the AVL Tree, but we will see
rotation
operation(s) to maintain the AVL Tree height to be low.

## Step 1: Maintaining height(v) Efficiently

To have efficient performance, we shall not maintain
height(v)
attribute via the O(
N
) recursive method every time there is an update (Insert(v)/Remove(v)) operation.
Instead, we compute O(
1
):
x.height = max(x.left.height, x.right.height) + 1
at the back of our Insert(v)/Remove(v) operation as only the height of vertices along the insertion/removal path may be affected. Thus, only O(
h
) vertices may change its
height(v)
attribute and in AVL Tree,
h
< 2 * log
N
.
Try
Insert(37)
on the example AVL Tree (ignore the resulting rotation for now, we will come back to it in the next few slides). Notice that only a few vertices along the insertion path: {41,20,29,32} increases their height by +1 and all other vertices will have their heights unchanged.

## Step 2: Define AVL Tree Invariant

Let's define the following important AVL Tree invariant (property that will never change): A vertex
v
is said to be
height-balanced
if
|v.left.height - v.right.height| ≤ 1
.
A BST is called height-balanced according to the invariant above if every vertex in the BST is height-balanced. Such BST is called AVL Tree, like the example shown above.
Take a moment to pause here and try inserting a few new random vertices or deleting a few random existing vertices. Will the resulting BST still considered height-balanced?

## Proof - 1

Adelson-Velskii and Landis claim that an AVL Tree (a height-balanced BST that satisfies AVL Tree invariant) with
N
vertices has height
h
< 2 * log
2
N
.
The proof relies on the concept of minimum-size AVL Tree of a certain height
h
.
Let
N
h
be the minimum number of vertices in a height-balanced AVL Tree of height
h
.
The first few values of
N
h
are
N
0
= 1
(a single root vertex),
N
1
= 2
(a root vertex with either one left child or one right child only),
N
2
= 4
,
N
3
= 7
,
N
4
= 12
,
N
5
= 20
(see the background picture), and so on (see the next two slides).

## Proof - 2

We know that for any AVL Tree of
N
vertices with height
h
(but not necessarily the minimum-size one), we have
N ≥ N
h
.
Example: In the background, we have
N
5
= 20
vertices but we know that we can squeeze 43 more vertices (up to
N = 63
) before we have a perfect binary tree of height
h = 5
.

## Proof - 3

N
h
= 1 + N
h-1
+ N
h-2
(formula for minimum-size AVL tree of height h)
N
h
> 1 + 2*N
h-2
(as N
h-1
> N
h-2
)
N
h
> 2*N
h-2
(obviously)
N
h
> 4*N
h-4
(recursive)
N
h
> 8*N
h-6
(another recursive step)
... (we can only do this h/2 times, assuming initial h is even)
N
h
> 2
h/2
*N
0
(we reach base case)
N
h
> 2
h/2
(as N
0
= 1)

## Proof - 4

N ≥ N
h
> 2
h/2
(combining the previous two slides)
N > 2
h/2
log
2
(N) > log
2
(2
h/2
) (log
2
on both sides)
log
2
(N) > h/2 (formula simplification)
2 * log
2
(N) > h or h < 2 * log
2
(N)
h = O(log(N)) (the final conclusion)

## Step 3: Maintain Invariant

Look at the example BST again. See that all vertices are height-balanced, an AVL Tree.
To quickly detect if a vertex
v
is height balanced or not, we modify the AVL Tree invariant (that has absolute function inside) into:
bf(v) = v.left.height - v.right.height
.
Now try
Insert(37)
on the example AVL Tree again. A few vertices along the insertion path: {41,20,29,32} increases their height by +1. Vertices {29,20} will no longer be height-balanced after this insertion (and will be rotated later — discussed in the next few slides), i.e. bf(29) = -2 and bf(20) = -2 too. We need to restore the balance.

## Introducing Tree Rotation

See the picture above. Calling
rotateRight(D)
on the left picture will produce the right picture. Calling
rotateLeft(B)
on the right picture will produce the left picture again.
rotateRight(T)
/
rotateLeft(T)
can only be called if
T
has a left/right child, respectively.
Tree Rotation
preserves
BST property.
Before rotation, A < B < C < D < E.
After rotation, notice that subtree rooted at C (if it exists) changes parent,
but the order of A < B < C < D < E does not change.

## Non-trivial O(1) Tree Rotation Pseudo-code

BSTVertex rotateLeft(BSTVertex T) // pre-req: T.right != null
BSTVertex w = T.right // rotateRight is the mirror copy of this
w.parent = T.parent // this method is hard to get right for newbie
T.parent = w
T.right = w.left
if (w.left != null) w.left.parent = T
w.left = T
// update the height of T and then w here
return w

## Four Rebalancing Cases

There are only these four cases:
Left Left Case: bf(F) = +2 and bf(D) = +1, solution: rotateRight(F)
Left Right Case: bf(F) = +2 and bf(B) = -1, solution: rotateLeft(B) first to transform this case into Left Left Case again, then go to step 1
Right Right Case: bf(B) = -2 and bf(D) = -1, solution: rotateLeft(B)
Right Left Case: bf(B) = -2 and bf(F) = +1, solution: rotateRight(F) first to transform this case into Right Right Case again, then go to step 3

## Insert(v) in AVL Tree

Just insert
v
as in normal BST,
Walk up the AVL Tree from the insertion point back to the root and at every step, we update the height and balance factor of the affected vertices:
Stop at the
first
vertex that is out-of-balance (+2 or -2), if any,
Use
one
of the four tree rotation cases to rebalance it again, e.g. try
Insert(37)
on the example above and notice by calling
rotateLeft(29)
once, we fix the imbalance issue.
Discussion: Is there other tree rotation cases for Insert(v) operation of AVL Tree?

## The Answer

There is no other case.
Insert(v) may indeed cause more than one vertex along the insertion path to have its height increase by one unit.
However, as soon as we fix the lowest vertex
x
that is out-of-balance by a bit (+2 or -2), the subsequent one (or double) rotation(s) will make the height of vertex
x
decreases by one again. Thus, any other vertices above
x
along the insertion path will no longer be out-of-balance anymore.

## Remove(v) in AVL Tree

Just remove
v
as in normal BST (one of the three removal cases),
Walk up the AVL Tree from the deletion point back to the root and at every step, we update the height and balance factor of the affected vertices:
Now for
every
vertex that is out-of-balance (+2 or -2), we use
one
of the four tree rotation cases to rebalance
them
(can be more than one) again.
The main difference compared to Insert(v) in AVL tree is that we may trigger one of the four possible rebalancing cases
several times
, but not more than
h
= O(log
N
) times :O, try
Remove(7)
on the example above to see two chain reactions
rotateRight(6)
and then
rotateRight(16)+rotateLeft(8)
combo.

## AVL Tree Summary

We have now see how AVL Tree defines the height-balance invariant, maintain it for all vertices during Insert(v) and Remove(v) update operations, and a proof that AVL Tree has
h
< 2 * log
N
.
Therefore,
all
BST operations (both update and query operations except Inorder Traversal) that we have learned so far, if they have time complexity of O(
h
), they have time complexity of O(log
N
) if we use AVL Tree version of BST.
This marks the end of this e-Lecture, but please switch to 'Exploration Mode' and try making various calls to Insert(v) and Remove(v) in AVL Tree mode to strengthen your understanding of this data structure.
PS: If you want to study how these seemingly complex AVL Tree (rotation) operations are implemented in a real program, you can download this

java
(must be used together with this

java
).

## Extras

We will end this module with a few more interesting things about BST and balanced BST (especially AVL Tree).

## Those 2 Extra BST Operations

You have seen how we augment height(v) attribute for AVL Tree rebalancing purposes. We now augment size(v) attribute too: The number of elements in the subtree of the BST rooted at
v
. We can maintain size(v) attribute during every insertion and deletion to AVL Tree as with height(v).
rank(v) = size(v.left)+1 (think about it).
For select(k), if rank(root) is k, we stop, otherwise we know which subtree to recurse on (think about it).

## Side Usage of Balanced BST?

In
Binary Heap
module, we learned an efficient data structure to implement Priority Queue ADT.
If you do not already realize it, we can also use BST, to be precise: any
balanced
BST, to implement Priority Queue ADT too. How?
